## Justin Jongstra - Software Developer based in The Netherlands

**Greetings!** I'm Justin Jongstra, a full-stack software developer based in The Netherlands. With a passion for
technology and continuous learning, I strive to create projects that combine innovation, functionality and creativity.

## Skills and Expertise

I specialize in Laravel for the most part, but I also have experience with other technologies such as PHP, Vue.js,
Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AdonisJS, Astro, Nuxt, TailwindCSS, and more. Additionally, I am proficient in using Linux as my operating system and I have experience with Windows and Windows Server as well.

## Other interests

I am also interested in Embedded Systems. I've always been fascinated by the low-level workings of computers and the
performance benefits that come with it, but my study's focus has been on web development. However, I do tinker with a
few Raspberry Pi projects in my free time.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and exploring new technologies. I love outdoor activities
such as mountain biking and have a particular interest in indoor plants. I'm also fond of drawing, using both traditional and digital mediums. Additionally, I am an avid gamer.
Some of my favorite games include Minecraft, Oxygen Not Included, and Factorio. I also like to cook / bake occasionally.
