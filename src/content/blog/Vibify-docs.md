## Why AstroJS?

AstroJS was the perfect choice for this project due to its themes and components, making it an ideal choice for creating a static documentation website. Additionally, the Starlight theme provides a clean and modern design that is easy to navigate, allowing users to find the information they need quickly and efficiently. After deciding to use Starlight, I started to notice a lot of other websites using it as well, which gave me confidence in my choice.

## Where can I find it?

You can access the Vibify-Docs documentation website at [vibify-docs.justinjongstra.nl](https://vibify-docs.justinjongstra.nl/). The website provides detailed instructions on how to interact with the Vibify API, including information on endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate Vibify into your project or a user curious about how it works, Vibify-Docs has you covered. It's still in development and currently only has the documentation for the [Vibify Client npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vibify/vibify) and [cURL requests](https://curl.se/), but more features are on the way.
