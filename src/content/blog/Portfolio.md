Join me on a reflective journey as I chronicle my experiences of building portfolio websites over time, each iteration leveraging different technologies. This post explores the evolution of my portfolio and the lessons learned along the way.

## Why?

Building a portfolio website isn't just about showcasing your work; it's a journey of self-discovery and technological exploration. My quest to create the perfect portfolio led me through a series of iterations, each offering valuable lessons and insights into the ever-evolving landscape of web development.

## What did I learn?

My journey began during my internship at webIQ, where I found myself with ample free time to delve into the realm of Laravel. With only a basic understanding of the framework, I embarked on my first attempt at crafting a portfolio. However, unsatisfied with the result, I sought to elevate my skills and decided to embrace Laravel Livewire for its dynamic capabilities. Integrating live components, GitHub links, and automatic fetching of languages from GitHub repositories to populate project tags, I aimed to create a more interactive and informative platform. Yet, despite these enhancements, I found myself yearning for simplicity and a stronger personal connection to my creation.

This desire for authenticity led me to explore alternative technologies, including Node.js with EJS and Express. While these iterations demonstrated impressive functionality, they lacked the essence of "me." It wasn't until I stumbled upon Nuxt.js and its familiarity with Vue.js that I felt a sense of alignment with my vision. However, even this iteration fell short of capturing the essence of my identity as a developer.

## What's next?

My journey took an unexpected turn when I discovered [Astro.js](https://astro.build/) and the [Starlight Theme](https://starlight.astro.build/) while working on another project, [Vibify](https://vibify-docs.justinjongstra.nl). Amidst exploring various templates, I had an epiphany: why invest countless hours crafting a portfolio when there are pre-existing solutions that align with my vision? Embracing this revelation, I adopted a template, personalized it to reflect my unique style, and swiftly brought my portfolio to life. This decision liberated me from the confines of endless iteration, allowing me to redirect my focus towards projects worthy of showcasing.

## Conclusion

My portfolio journey epitomizes the iterative nature of development, marked by experimentation, adaptation, and ultimately, acceptance. Through each iteration, I honed my skills, discovered new technologies, and most importantly, uncovered the importance of authenticity in my work. While the path to perfection may be paved with countless revisions, sometimes the most profound discoveries arise from embracing simplicity and leveraging existing solutions. As I continue to evolve as a developer, my portfolio serves not only as a testament to my skills but as a reminder of the journey that brought me to where I am today.
