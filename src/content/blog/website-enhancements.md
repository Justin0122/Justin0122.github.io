**Project Overview:**

I've recently made some exciting updates to my website, which is built using an Astro theme. These enhancements include integrating Swup for smoother navigation, adding a theme switcher to customize background colors, and implementing a locale switcher to toggle between English and Dutch. These features aim to improve user experience and offer greater customization options for visitors.

## New Features

### 1. **Improved Navigation with Swup**

To enhance the navigation experience on my website, I've integrated [Swup](https://swup.js.org/). This JavaScript library provides seamless transitions between pages, making the browsing experience smoother and more engaging. Swup loads new content without a full page refresh, which reduces loading times and provides a more fluid interaction.

### 2. **Theme Switcher**

Another feature I've added is a simple theme switcher to change the background color of the website to suit different preferences.

### 3. **Locale Switcher for Multilingual Support**

To make the website more inclusive, I've implemented a locale switcher that allows users to toggle between English and Dutch. This feature provides multilingual support, catering to a wider audience and enhancing accessibility.

## Implementation Details

- **Astro Theme**: The website is built using an Astro theme, which provides a solid foundation for adding custom functionalities.
- **Swup**: Integrated for enhancing navigation with smooth page transitions.
- **Theme Switcher**: Custom-built to allow users to select different background colors.
- **Locale Switcher**: Implemented to support multiple languages, enhancing accessibility.

## Outcome

These updates have significantly improved the user experience on my website. The integration of Swup has made navigation smoother, while the theme and locale switchers offer greater personalization options. Overall, these enhancements contribute to a more dynamic and user-friendly website.
