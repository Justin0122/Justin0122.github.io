To ensure data integrity, the system maintains audit trails for tracking changes and maintaining data integrity.

This project was primarily developed for the company my girlfriend works for, which is using Excel sheets to manage their inventory. The goal was to create a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction. However, the project was put on hold due to other priorities. Another reason for this project was to learn more about the supply chain management domain.

## Objectives

1. Create a Supply Chain Management system that allows users to manage their inventory.
2. Implement features such as adding, updating, and deleting products, viewing product details, and searching for products.
3. Provide a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.
4. Ensure audit trails for tracking changes and maintaining data integrity.
5. Learn more about the supply chain management domain.
6. Develop a project for a real-world scenario.

## Technology Stack

- Laravel 10: For server-side logic.
- LiveWire: For creating dynamic interfaces.
- MySQL: For the database.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling the user interface.
- Deployment: Hosted on a Raspberry Pi.

## Outcome

The SCM project has allowed me to create a Supply Chain Management system that allows users to manage their inventory. The project was developed for a real-world scenario and helped me learn more about the supply chain management domain. Although the project is put on hold and probably won't be continued, it was a great learning experience.
